# Presentation

Hi! This project was made as a challenge using React. The app uses the Random Users Generator API and makes a grid filled with those users. You can also select any user and it shows you a more detailed description of them.
The whole app is responsive and have some animations in it.

# Web Site Functionalities

## Users page

Shows a grid that contains 50 users and shows 50 more when you get to the bottom page (infinite scroll). All the users are contained in little Cards with a picture, full name, city and country where they belong.

## User description page

There is also a button to go back to the main page.
